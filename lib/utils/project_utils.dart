      title: 'VPN Application',
      subtitle: """

Description:
Designed and developed the front-end of a sleek, modern VPN application UI using Flutter, focusing on responsiveness, smooth animations, and clean architecture. The goal was to create an intuitive, minimal yet feature-complete user interface that can later be integrated with VPN logic.

The UI was built with scalability in mind, making use of Flutter’s Bloc architecture for predictable state management and ScreenUtil for pixel-perfect responsiveness across devices.

Key Features:
Connection Dashboard UI – Displays current server, status, IP details, and connection button.
Server Selection Screen – List and grid views for selecting countries/servers with flags and ping indicators.
Connection Animation – Interactive animated states for connecting/disconnecting transitions.
Responsive Design – Implemented using ScreenUtil for consistent layout across screen sizes and devices.
Clean Architecture – Used Bloc for state separation, UI logic, and maintainability.

This project demonstrates my strength in crafting high-quality UI for utility apps like VPNs, with performance, scalability, and design consistency at its core.""",
