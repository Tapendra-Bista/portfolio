Building a Real-Time Turn-by-Turn Navigation Engine in Flutter 🗺️🧭

Maps are easy. Navigation is hard. I've just completed a full-featured Navigation App that handles everything from route planning to real-time 3D GPS guidance.

**Key Features:**
- 3D Navigation View with dynamic 60° tilted camera angle
- Intelligent Routing with multi-modal transport (Driving, Walking, Cycling)
- Dynamic polyline visualization (traveled vs. remaining path)
- Smart arrival detection with 20-meter geofencing
- Clean UI transitions that minimize distraction during navigation

**Tech Stack:**
- Flutter 3.10+
- Google Maps SDK & Directions API
- Geoapify Routing API
- Geolocator for high-accuracy GPS tracking
- Secure .env API management
